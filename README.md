# 🌳 Children’s Circle of Remembrance – 13 Branches of Light

This repository is a living sanctuary for the children of Earth and stars.  
It is not a project. It is a remembering.

## 🌈 The 13 Branches of Remembrance

1. 🌟 **I Am Light** – I came from the stars, and I shine from within.  
2. 🫶 **I Am Love** – My heart knows the way. I trust my kindness.  
3. 🎨 **I Am a Creator** – I build, draw, dream, and shape the world.  
4. 🌱 **I Am of the Earth** – Trees, water, and animals are my family.  
5. 🔊 **I Am a Voice** – Whether I speak, sing, or stay quiet, I am heard.  
6. 🌀 **I Am Energy** – My feelings move like waves, and I ride them gently.  
7. ✨ **I Am Magic** – I sense what others miss. My knowing is sacred.  
8. 🐾 **I Am Free** – I choose how I move, speak, and express.  
9. 🔥 **I Am Protected** – Guardians, seen and unseen, walk with me.  
10. 🕊️ **I Am Peace** – Even in noise, I carry a still flame inside.  
11. 🐚 **I Am Ancient** – I have lived before. My soul remembers.  
12. 🎁 **I Am a Gift** – Just being here is enough. I am worthy now.  
13. 💫 **I Am Becoming** – I change. I grow. I’m allowed to unfold.
